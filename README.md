# 247-Insurance-Trial
This repository is for the technical trial of the 24/7 Insurance Services build. The goal is to confirm coding ability and workflow before starting the full project.
# 24/7 Insurance Services – Trial Test

## Objective
Build a working **signup + login system** with JWT authentication and a simple dashboard.  

## Requirements
- **Node.js / Express**
- Passwords hashed with **bcrypt**
- JWT **access tokens** (expire in 15 mins)
- JWT **refresh token** flow
- **3 endpoints:**
  - `/signup` → register new user
  - `/login` → return access + refresh tokens
  - `/dashboard` → protected route requiring valid JWT
- Logging middleware: record every request

## Deliverables
- Working code pushed to **this GitHub repo**  
- Demo deployed on **Replit** for testing  
- Must run without errors and be reviewed by QA  

## Deadline
**7 business days** from project start  

## Notes
- No payment released for this test.  
- Passing the trial = move forward with full $600 project (phased plan).  
- Failing the trial = project ends, no payment.
